Hi, I am 0ryX (oryx): a developer with a interest in breaking things. From bug bounty to reverse engineering, to malware development, I love coding and understanding how 
how computers work.

Currently my focus is on learning Rust and lower-level programming like C because it is the mother language and both are excellent for malware developement and game dev. 
I use Arch Linux and find home within the terminal and Vim, I am also a huge advocate for FOSS, OpenSource and GNU Software. 

The data dragnet that is our modern internet has now become the corporate web. But there are still little corners of the internet where you can find decentralized communities
and that's where you will find me. Since Github is owned by Microsoft I mainly use Codebery now, but github still has it's perks and if your gonna be in the industry you might
as well have one.
